# Polyglot-Backtracking

A repository for exploring and analyzing **backtracking** algorithms across multiple programming languages.

This project is a requirement for a **Theory of Computation** course. The primary goal is to compare implementations based on three main axes:

1.  **Performance:** Execution time and memory usage.
2.  **Expressiveness:** Readability, clarity, and lines of code.
3.  **Paradigm:** The idiomatic approach for each language (imperative, functional, etc.).

---

## The Languages

Languages were chosen to highlight differences in paradigm and performance:

* **Python (High-Level):** Focus on clarity and speed of implementation.
* **C++ (Compiled):** Focus on raw performance and low-level optimization.
* **Java (Object-Oriented):** Focus on structure, maintainability, and balance between abstraction and performance.

---

## How to Use

Each problem directory (e.g., `n-queens/`) contains its own `README.md` with specific build and execution instructions.

### General Requirements:
* C++ compiler (g++, clang)
* Python 3 interpreter
* Java 17+ (or compatible JDK)

Benchmark scripts and performance results can be found in the `/analysis` directory.
